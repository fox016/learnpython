Solution for opening dictionary file:
- User defines a variable named dictionary_file that is a string path to their dictionary file. They are then allowed to use "open(dictionary_file)" and that is the only allowed open command (blacklist every other open command on server end). On the server I replace the instantiation of the dictionary_file variable with a path to my own dictionary file.
