Technology is constantly changing and improving. Technology has the power to affect all aspects of our society: family life, education, communication, entertainment, public health, and more. For those who understand the fundamentals of technology, technology is a tool that they have power over. Those who do not understand these fundamentals may find themselves as slaves to the technology they use. Learning to code is an important part of learning the fundamentals of the technologies that are such an integral part of modern society.

<h2>What is Coding?</h2>

<p>
Simply put, coding is writing commands to a computer. Computer code is a series of specific, unambiguous commands that tell the computer what to do. Computers function by writing data to memory, reading data from memory, and performing computations on that data. Commands can be used to tell the computer to display text, to perform mathematical functions on numbers, to process user input, etc.

<h2>What are Programming Languages?</h2>

<p>
Unfortunately, computers don't speak English. English is too ambiguous for computers to understand perfectly. Here are some common examples of English ambiguity:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>A good life depends on the liver</strong> - "Liver" may be an organ or a living person</li>
	<li><strong>Foreigners are hunting dogs</strong> - Are the foreigners going hunting for dogs, or are they dogs that hunt?</li>
	<li><strong>Each of us saw her duck</strong> - Did we see a duck that she owns, or did we see her perform the action of ducking down?</li>
	<li><strong>Passerby helps dog bite victim</strong> - Did the passerby help a victim of a dog bite, or did the passerby help a dog to bite a victim?</li>
</ul>

<p>
To avoid these problems with ambiguity, computers speak a language called <em>binary</em> or <em>machine code</em>. Binary is a language made up of 0s and 1s, and the computer hardware interprets these 0s and 1s (known as <em>bits</em>) to control electrical voltages in the computer, and those electrical voltages carry out the commands. On a 64-bit operating system, every command is composed of a series of 64 bits. In the early days of computing, programmers wrote commands in 0s and 1s. This works because computers can understand the language of binary without ambiguity.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, it is very hard for humans to read and understand binary code. Writing and maintaining binary code is difficult and requires a lot of work just to write basic commands that accomplish very little. What we need is a language that computers can understand perfectly and that humans can easily read and write. <em>Programming languages</em> meet the needs of both computers and human coders. Programming languages define language rules that are unambiguous and can be translated directly into binary for computers, and they also use syntax that is relatively easy for humans to read and write.
